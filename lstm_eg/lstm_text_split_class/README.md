# RNN_Text_Classify

This code belongs to the ["implement a RNN for text classification in Tensorflow"](http://blog.csdn.net/u010223750/article/details/53334313) POST






## Requirements

Python 2.7

Tensorflow ï¼š 0.11(tensorflow with version 1.0 is not supported here, you can transform the code into tensorflow1.0 using the scripts   provided by tensorflow offical website,or you can find some solutions in #issue3)








## Training
train_rnn_classify.py

## note
this code save the model checkpoints and save the summary at given epoch, these actions will slow down the training speed,so if you want to do a quick job, just remove these codes if you need
